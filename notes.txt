1. H-Bridge Motor Control

An H-Bridge is a switching circuit used to drive DC motors in both directions. It consists of four transistors (or MOSFETs) arranged in an “H” configuration.

By turning on opposite pairs of switches, the motor rotates clockwise or counterclockwise.

Applying PWM signals controls motor speed.

Commonly used in robotics, automation, and microcontroller-based motor drivers.

2. PNP & NPN Overvoltage Protection

Overvoltage can damage circuits, so protection using PNP and NPN transistors is applied.

Under normal voltage, the transistors remain off.

When voltage exceeds a safe limit, the transistors conduct, diverting excess current away from sensitive components.

Often combined with resistors or zener diodes to define the threshold.

Widely used in protecting power supplies, microcontrollers, and motor drivers from spikes or back EMF.
